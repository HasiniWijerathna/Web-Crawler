The Galaxy S7 was wonderful while it worked. Great screen, great battery life, decent software, amazing camera, MicroSD slot. Everything you'd want in a phone. The waterproof claim is also impressive, although I was never bold enough to test it. I put the phone in a rugged UAG case and babied it, hoping to get a few years out of it. However, six months after purchasing, the screen suddenly began to die. Half the screen is now dead despite there being no physical damage or trauma to the phone. I babied this thing, seriously. No drops, no scratches, no cracks, nothing. I suspect a manufacture defect with the screen's connector or something. First, I called Samsung. They refuse to repair international versions of the Galaxy S7, even if you offer to pay for the repair. Then, I called the seller about getting this repaired or RMA'd. They didn't respond. I contacted Amazon and they also contacted the seller. No response. I called the seller, no one picked up the phone and the voice mail box was full. Spend the extra cash and get this from a different seller. I'm out a lot of money for a faulty phone. For more information about this defect google "vertical lines in screen," - it seems fairly common and most people have a similar story.

I bought this phone about 10 months ago and everything seemed fine but then it just stopped working. Now I understand that it is a 10 month old phone but I always use a case and glass screen protector and I'm very careful with my phone. So I called Samsung and the factory warranty is for another country, they tell me to contact the seller. So I emailed them for about a week begging they replace or refund my phone and they kept telling me no and they were being very rude. So finally I decided to just take my phone to be repaired, I took it to a phone repair shop and 15 minutes after I give it to the employee he tells me the back of the phone is a replacement back. I told him "that can't be I bought the phone brand new online" and he picked up the back and showed me the inside of it and it has writing on it. (and I forgot to mention that he broke the back taking it off bacause it's a cheap replacement back) There were also 2 screws he said were missing and that basically the phone might as well be a refurbished phone. So long story short, the sellers are very rude and unhelpful and they are also dishonest about their products, DO NOT BUY FROM THEM! You will regret it.

The description on this phone said Dual Sim and it wasn't. I tried putting in a second SIM after buying one and was told the phone was for a single SIM. That is false marketing. I want myou money back or a DUAL Sim phone

I bought this on June 29, 2016. So far this phone has given me no problems. It doesn't overheat, there are no problems with the software, it hasn't turned off unexpectantly, overall I'm pretty satisfied. I was afraid I would get a bad one but I didn't. The camara quality is amazing! I'm completely satisfied. Read more
The phone stopped working after a few months and we can't refer to the manufacturers warranty in Vietnam! They have no english support and we were given very little help from Breed or Amazon.

I own Galaxy S7 and indeed it works to my perfection. Qualify camera, fastest browsing, powerful battery life( 24hrs useful without charging and over 24hrs when set to battery saver mode. Users who likes internet browsing could use between 22-24hrs)

I'm not reviewing the GS7. It's a great phone. I'm very happy with it. I'm reviewing the seller. I received a new sealed GS7 for Italy I believe (TIM) is the carrier. plugged the micro sim from my AT&T GS6 and went through the usual startup process. Everything went perfect. I set the language to english and I'm using AT&T's 4g LTE network. I didn't have to add any AP names or anything. It just worked. It's seems to be just as good or bad as the GS6 (AT&T branded) that I was using before. I was also able to uninstall all the TIM apps, which has not been my experience with AT&T and other US carriers. I can usually disable most of them but not uninstall completely. If I bought this from AT&T it would have cost about $200 more (crazy that the price is still the same as when it was released since it will likely be replaced in 3 months with the GS8) and I would have been forced to reprovision a new sim card for some reason which would take time which is the same as more money and I would have a bunch of AT&T apps taking up memory.
